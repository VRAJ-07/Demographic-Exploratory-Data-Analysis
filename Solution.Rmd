# 1. Review the data table and look at the data types, distributions, values, etc.
# a. Detail any interesting patterns or issues you see.

# Data Types:
#   - `first_name` and `last_name` are categorical variables (character).
#   - `gender` is categorical (character), representing gender categories.
#   - `age` is a numeric variable representing the age of individuals.
#   - `education` is categorical, describing the education level.
#   - `marital_status` is categorical, indicating the marital status.
#   - `occupation_group` is categorical, representing the occupation group.
#   - `credit_score` is a numeric variable indicating the credit score.
#   - `address`, `city`, and `state` are categorical variables containing address information.
#   - `home_build_year` is numeric, representing the year in which the home was built.

# Interesting Patterns and Issues:
#   - `age` shows the age of individuals, which could be used to analyze age distribution within the dataset.
#   - `education` and `occupation_group` could provide insights into the educational and occupational diversity of the population.
#   - `credit_score` could be used to analyze the creditworthiness of individuals.
#   - The `marital_status` variable indicates the marital status of individuals, which can be used to examine marital status distribution.
#   - `home_build_year` shows the year in which homes were built and could be used for analyzing trends in home construction.

# 2. Perform any necessary data cleaning and/or transformations. This could include, but not limited to, missing data, outliers, generation of new variables, binning, etc.
# a. In addition to the code, explain in detail what you did and why you did it?
# b. Are you making any assumptions? If so, what are they?

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read the demographic dataset
demographic_data <- read.csv("demographic.csv")

# 2. Perform Data Cleaning and Transformations

# a. Handling Missing Data
# Check for missing values and impute missing age values with the median age.
demographic_data <- demographic_data %>%
  mutate(age = ifelse(is.na(age), median(age, na.rm = TRUE), age))

# Explanation for a:
# Missing data in the 'age' column is handled by checking for missing values using 'is.na'.
# Missing values are imputed with the median age of the dataset.
# This imputation strategy is chosen to preserve the distribution of ages and minimize bias.

# b. Outlier Detection and Treatment
# Identify and remove outliers in the 'credit_score' variable using the IQR method.
Q1 <- quantile(demographic_data$credit_score, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(demographic_data$credit_score, 0.75)
IQR <- Q3 - Q1
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
demographic_data <- demographic_data %>%
  filter(credit_score >= lower_bound, credit_score <= upper_bound)

# Explanation for b:
# Outliers in the 'credit_score' variable are identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
# Lower and upper bounds are calculated based on the IQR.
# Data points outside these bounds are considered outliers and are removed from the dataset.
# This treatment is applied to ensure that extreme values in 'credit_score' do not distort analysis.

# 3. Summarize and/or aggregate the data table values in various ways with descriptive stats, counts, etc. over the entire dataset and by various groupings.
# a. Explain each summarization step and why you did it. What patterns are you seeing?

# a. Summarization Steps and Explanations

# Calculate descriptive statistics for numeric variables
numeric_summary <- demographic_data %>%
  select(age, credit_score, home_build_year) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min_Age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Credit_Score = mean(credit_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Credit_Score = median(credit_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Credit_Score = sd(credit_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Credit_Score = max(credit_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min_Credit_Score = min(credit_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_Home_Build_Year = mean(home_build_year, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_Home_Build_Year = median(home_build_year, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Home_Build_Year = sd(home_build_year, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max_Home_Build_Year = max(home_build_year, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min_Home_Build_Year = min(home_build_year, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Explanation for a:
# - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, max, min) are calculated for numeric variables:
#   age, credit_score, and home_build_year.
# - This helps understand the central tendency, spread, and range of these variables.

# Count the number of individuals by gender
gender_counts <- demographic_data %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

# Explanation for a:
# - Gender counts are calculated to understand the distribution of individuals by gender.

# View the numeric summary and gender counts

# 4. Leveraging the analyses in steps 1-3, create at least four different plots over variables you finding interesting to include univariate and multivariate (covariation) analyses. Make sure the plots are customized appropriately with labels, titles, colors, and themes.
# a. Explain each visual and why you chose to use this particular plot.
# b. Interpret what each plot is showing and what this could say about the demographics provided (e.g. trends such as age distribution or gender distribution).
# c. What overall patterns and/or trends do you see?
# d. How do the visuals add to your previous review and summarization?
# e. Do the visuals you provided tell a bigger story (when looked at together), i.e. do the individual plots coalesce into a larger narrative about the demographic data?

library(ggplot2)

# a. Explanation of Visuals and Why Chosen:

# Visual 1: Histogram of Age Distribution
# - A histogram is chosen to visualize the distribution of ages.
# - Understanding the age distribution is essential in demographic analysis.
ggplot(demographic_data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Age Distribution",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency")

# Visual 2: Bar Plot of Gender Distribution
# - A bar plot is chosen to show the count of individuals by gender.
# - It provides a clear visual representation of gender distribution.
ggplot(gender_counts, aes(x = gender, y = Count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Count")

# Visual 3: Scatter Plot of Age vs. Credit Score
# - A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between age and credit score.
# - It helps identify any trends or patterns in how age relates to credit score.
ggplot(demographic_data, aes(x = age, y = credit_score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Credit Score",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Credit Score")

# Visual 4: Box Plot of Age by Education Level
# - A box plot is chosen to visualize the distribution of age across different education levels.
# - It allows for comparisons of age distributions within each education group.
ggplot(demographic_data, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = education)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Age by Education Level",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Age")

# b. Interpretation of Visuals:

# Visual 1:
# - The histogram shows a roughly normal distribution of age.
# - There is a peak in the mid-30s to mid-40s age group.
# - This suggests that the dataset contains a diverse range of ages.

# Visual 2:
# - The bar plot indicates that the dataset has a fairly balanced gender distribution.
# - There is a roughly equal number of males and females.
# - This information is important for gender-related demographic analysis.

# Visual 3:
# - The scatter plot shows a scattered distribution of data points for age and credit score.
# - There doesn't appear to be a strong linear relationship between age and credit score.
# - There is no clear pattern that suggests age strongly influences credit score.

# Visual 4:
# - The box plot displays the age distribution for each education level.
# - It reveals variations in age across different education groups.
# - For example, individuals with a "Master's Degree" tend to be older on average.

# c. Overall Patterns and Trends:
# - The age distribution is roughly normal, with a peak in the mid-30s to mid-40s.
# - Gender distribution is fairly balanced in the dataset.
# - There is no strong linear relationship between age and credit score.
# - Age distribution varies across different education levels.

# d. Contribution of Visuals:
# - Visuals provide a more intuitive understanding of the data compared to summary statistics.
# - They allow for quick identification of patterns and trends.

# e. Coalescing Story:
# - When looked at together, the visuals help build a narrative about the demographics.
# - We can see the diversity in age, gender balance, lack of a strong age-credit score relationship,
#   and age variations by education level.

# Explaination of Outputs :
